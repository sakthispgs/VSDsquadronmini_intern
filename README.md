_The VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V SoC device available on the development board is programmed using the on-board flash programmer which supports the CH32V305FBP6 single-wire programming protocol, enabling streamlined and efficient development workflows directly on the board. Connect the VSDSquadron Mini board using a USB C connector to program the CH32V003F4U6 chip._
